  "My father was sitting in his house on a bench when he heard a bang in the yard and went outside to see what it was. The storm had just begun," he said.

 So I came up with a plan. I'd be a better bookseller and my customers would love me. I'd be selling books at a profit and I'd be able to afford to pay my staff. I'd also be able to afford to buy the books and the staff. I'd do all of this while keeping the money I made as a storekeeper. All of the books I sold would go up in price. I'd be able to buy more books.   And I could write more books. I didn

  "She had been through the worst of it," said her friend and her mother, Sue. "I told her, 'You don't understand, you're not going to get to drive, you're going to have to come back.'

 He was wearing the same shirt every day. His parents were too busy to notice. He was a good-looking kid, and he had a nice face. He had friends. He was a good kid.  But he was gay, too.  It wasn't even the first time he'd gotten into trouble.  He'd been arrested a few times, but these were the first instances where he had been sent to jail for being gay.

 I was nervous for the first time in my life, but I was also nervous for the first time in my life. I started to take notes and I was very excited. I didn't know what to do with them.

 I'm a bit anxious because it's coming from a place where I bought something that I had been trying for years to do so.

 He'd sit at the kitchen table and eat a salad.  It was like he'd been there for years.  He had no idea what the world was like before the war. He was still learning, but he knew he was smart.

His mother and father were dead, too, when he was born

 So he had to buy a rabbit from a rabbit rescue center. He kept the rabbit but kept it in a cage. In a few years, the rabbit got sick and died.

"When I started looking into the history of the rabbit, I became obsessed," she says. "I read about this rabbit

  She was alone in the room. It was dark outside, and the curtains drawn too close to her. She thought about the people around her, from the ones who looked at her through the window to the people who looked through her window with her. She thought about the people who had come to look at her over the past few years. She thought about the people who had come to her over her own life.  She remembered her mother, her father, the people who had taught her to read and write, who had taught her how to love and
 She is in shock and is now trying to figure out what happened. A police spokesperson says they have been told she went to sleep in an unoccupied room and that they have been told there were no charges laid because she's not a suspect in any crime.

  On Thursday, March 17, I received a letter from the DMV that said the driver's license was not in the correct account at the time of the crash, and that I should have sent it to them with my money in cash.

  I'm sure I should have used a good quality cookie dough recipe.  But I also knew I was going to have to make something similar on my own.  So I did what anyone would do when their first batch isn't perfect — I tried the same recipe again.  And I have to say, the new batch was very tasty.  So I decided to give my recipe a try.  I ended up creating this pie filling and it was sooo good.  I made it for Easter last week.
 She tried to sell them at a good price, but the sellers refused to sell. "I went to a friend of mine and said, 'I'm going to sell these clothes and I'm going to sell them for $300.' At the moment, I'm thinking, 'What am I going to do?'" Jenna says.  Her friend offered to pay the cash price, but Jenna could not afford the price. The friend told her to go to the bank and give it to the bank. The bank refused to give it to her. "I
 In his phone box, he found an empty envelope with a note, dated Dec. 21, 2011, from an unidentified company. It instructed him to send a check for $50,000 to a bank in Atlanta. At the bank, he was told to send the money to the account of a relative who lived in Georgia.  In the note, "Michael" wrote, "Dear Mike, I am calling you after seeing your article in the newspaper."

It was a dream.' So I bought it and I put it away."  A few weeks later, the mother of two received a call from the police. The officer told her that her daughter had left her
 The money was just piling up in his pocket.  When I asked him what he was going to do with all that money, he said, "I'm going to put it into an IRA." He told me he was going to put it in his IRA to invest in stocks. He did have a checking account under the name "H. H. Hagen," but it was really just an account in his name.  He told me he was going to save that money for retirement—and he was going to do it soon.
 She's not very good at ordering online, so she had to come in and try on the shirts first. She didn't like them at all. They were too small, and her shirt wasn't even close to being covered in cotton. When she got home, she wasn't happy with the fit either. She thought about buying a different shirt, but decided it would be better to just find any outfit that fit better.  As she looked around in her closet,
 His hair was longer and his body fat had dropped significantly. The doctor said he had to lose another 60 pounds to stop his heart.

She'd only spent a few minutes at security, but she already knew that she was late. She
 That's when he saw the signs. It was for a friend's family, but he was too scared to open the door. She was driving and he couldn't see her. What did the signs say?  "Don't drive the SUV."

 Another one kicked me in the stomach. At first I thought it was a joke. I had no idea what they were doing...I was worried. I kept thinking that maybe they were going to make me into a toy.

 She tried to convince her mom that she could make ramen noodles for dinner.  "I just want to live life," she said. "I want to live in the present."

  "I've had to cancel my policies, but that's why I'm here," he said. "I'm going to get better."  The problem is that the current insurance industry has yet to develop a technology to replace the human brain.

 "My favorite is your favorite," she says. "It's the one with a zipper."  The zipper, of course, is the perfect way to close your jacket and keep your legs warm.

  Instead, he got in touch with the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy is not a place to be.  A couple of months later, snow started falling.

 She couldn't keep up with the pace of her workouts.  "I looked at weight loss and exercise as two sides of the same coin," she said.

"I thought I ate two slices."  "Well
 He didn't even have a car. He had never been to a car dealership before and he wanted to get behind the wheel of his own car. He didn't have the money to buy a new car.

  The Pirate Ship was the same as the one Amy was on: the ship was a huge, old, rusting ship, with no signs of life.

 I was standing at the corner of Main Street and West Broadway in New York. It was 8:30 AM and I had just arrived at my apartment, which is two blocks away, to find that my apartment was now on fire.

 I went to a movie theater, but there was no music. So I took a job in the kitchen of a restaurant where I worked all night. It was there that I heard the Grateful Dead perform live. I had fallen in love with music and it was the perfect choice. By 2006 I was at home recording and playing records around the house and I started to get more and more into progressive rock and punk.  I think the most influential influence on the band is the punk rock era. I think it's

  But he soon realised that he was not really the same as his mother. He was not her son anymore. He was not her husband. He was just a different person.  It was the same for Julie too. She was still a child, too. She was still a baby. She was still a girl.  Julian's mother's house had been burned down many times. But her mother never let out the truth about her true identity. Her secret had been kept since she was a baby.
 His favourite games were the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. He also enjoyed playing the Guitar Hero series, and he loved the games that allowed you to play the guitar solo. He enjoyed creating art and creating artwork for the games.  It was at this time that I met him and he introduced himself as "Alex". I didn't know much about him, but I was intrigued.

  "I was looking for something with stripes so I could wear it all year round," he said. "I wanted something that didn't get too bulky." He chose a dress from the online store.  On the day he ordered it, he noticed that the dress was too short. He thought that he'd need to purchase longer, and when he did, he discovered that the length of the dress was far too long.

 It was fantastic. We thought she would be out of trouble, but she would be back within two days. And then she wrote the report herself. It was all in a letter to the editor. The author said, "I was so ashamed of myself for writing such a worthless piece of work. I am so sorry I didn't tell the truth."  She'd been a very good secretary and really helped her husband, and she was so nice and kind.  I asked her what she thought

 He loved to go camping," said C.D. Smith, who grew up with Tuck.  "I would bring him anything, especially the food. But I know he was a bad kid."

 He turned again when he saw the huge, white cloud that was rising in the distance. The cloud was rising fast, and it was the greatest cloud in his life.  The sun was setting, and the rain was falling hard. And the wind was coming down from above.  "Well, you're pretty busy right now," he muttered to himself. He was worried that if he looked up now he would see this huge cloud rising around him. It was a cloud, but it was huge. It looked like a
 Then, she asked one of the cookery teachers if she could get a plate of chips. The teacher said she couldn't.  "And I said, 'I can get that for you, but I'm not going to get a plate.'

 My mom and I were having a nice, relaxing afternoon. Then suddenly, the doorbell rang. It was the girl I've been talking to for the past two days. The girl is my mother. Her family is from the city, so her family is not from here. I know that because my mom has talked about it, but I've never told her. She's from outside of the country, and I guess she hasn't heard of me. But she did ask if I wanted to come in. It was a big birthday party for
  It was the first time anyone had seen her, and she was pale and stiff. She looked like a zombie. She was lying on the floor, blood dripping from her mouth.  "I don't know if it's a sign of death, but she's just a wreck. I can't believe this has happened. I'm starting to believe that this is the end."  "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." Ruby said. "I just…I don't know what to say. I don't know if I'm supposed

  "The next morning, we found out why," he said. "The police didn't want to let me play with the kids, because I was the one who would be arrested if we got caught."  That was the beginning of the end.  In the summer of 2007, he was ordered to stop playing with the kids and was charged with criminal mischief.  He was convicted of making threats and sentenced to seven years in prison.  It's hard to put into words the horror of what he went through

 She got off at the first stop, and went to the next one, then the next one, until she reached the last stop. Finally, she walked past the last stop and walked across the street to the other end.

However, she was surprised that the Greek sign was even there, and she asked the person next to her, "What's that?" The person responded, "I'm
 She returned to the store and asked the cashier for the receipt.  "She said, 'Oh, you didn't tell me you were leaving.' I said, 'No, I didn't,'" Shaw recalled.

 She would sing along, but she would always be interrupted by a loud, abusive voice telling her what to do. Peter was never able to get his daughter to sing along.

Peter tried to teach her the songs and they were great. Peter was happy that he was able to do that and he would tell her that she was amazing. But she wouldn't listen to him. She would sing
 We knew he was going to be sick. So we decided to try and get him back to normality by going to a party with him.  We got to the party and found out that he had an infection on his leg. His doctor told us that in three months it would take the doctors out of the hospital to come back and fix it. It took us about one hour to figure out how to get him back and we went home and slept on the couch. When the next morning, he woke up and
 He told his wife to take care of the pest.  He said that he was proud of his work ethic and did not show any resentment towards his wife. He did not expect her to take care of it himself.  He went to the police and told them about the pest that caused the crop to fail. After he made his confession, the police informed him that the pest was not a human, but an alien. They said it was not a human disease, as it was a parasite. The police took the pest from the house
 They also knew he would look so much better if he were. Jim said it was just not a good idea to be at the circus with his little boy.

 I can't drink for more than thirty seconds. I can't drink for more than ten seconds if I drink too much. If I drink too much, I'd probably drink even more.

It was a place where they would play chess and sell me a chessboard. We'd get two or three hours of chess every day.  After I
 We never saw him again. He was a very sweet man. He loved his wife, his daughter, and his dogs. He was a great, kind man. There are many things he did for us, and I'm trying to remember them all, but I just can't.

 It was the first time I had done it in a long time. I had been so used to using two hands for cooking that I never noticed that I was doing something completely different. The tea cups looked like they were made of wood and felt very heavy.  I felt an urge to toss them into the trash. I was pretty sure that I had done something wrong.  I looked at the cup in my hand. It appeared that the tea had been left out longer than it should have.  "Why did you do

 What would you do if your child is in debt?  To be honest, I never thought about that. I knew what I couldn't afford. I knew I couldn't go out, so I paid the bills. But my daughter was in school, so I went out — and I thought that was good.  What's your daughter's favorite movie?  I'm not allowed to talk about it. She's not allowed to talk about her own life. I'm always trying to keep my mouth

 So he decided to call a taxi and ask for a ride. He was on the taxi driver's side of the driver, and the driver was his friend, who knew him personally. He wanted to go to his friend's house to hang out, and they arranged for him to pay the taxi driver, and the taxi driver paid the taxi driver. So there was no money for anything else. So he got on the taxi and left, and after that it was really boring.  Then, one day, the taxi driver got
  He was 18.  He'd been taking the SAT by the time he was 18, and in high school he had scored better than any other student. After some time he wanted to go to college, but his parents were against it, and he didn't want to be the reason his parents couldn't afford it. He didn't want to be a burden on his family. He wanted to be the best he could be. But he wasn't very good at math. He couldn't do it.  So he started
  "The cat was very excited. She was so happy. She came and I took her to my house. She was very happy and very cute."  Folkestone says dogs are not welcome at his home, which is located in a small subdivision in the town of Pembroke.  "I've had dogs for almost 50 years. They know me by name and love to eat my food. I've had several dogs come to my house and they were very good."  He says he has also
 He was a good student. He loved sports. He loved to play with other dogs. I love him, and I hope he can find his way back to school. I want him to grow up to be a good man and a good father to his children. I know that his dogs will be there.  I am not surprised that he is not back with his family. I know that he is not going to get his life back, and I have heard it from people so many times, that I feel bad for him. I know that the police are going to
 He was told he might not be able to get into university. A friend of his father's said, 'You should go back to school - it's cheaper.' He did so and went to university. That was in 1989.

 She loved it. She had a crush on a guy who was gay, and she wanted to have sex with him. She was happy, and she wanted to be accepted. It was the perfect girl.  Then, one day, she went to a karaoke bar and sang badly that same night. The guys at the bar all sang along, and she was left in the dark. She was devastated. She couldn't imagine what she was going to do next.  Then, one night, she
  "I tried on about four pairs of headphones," she said. "It was terrible. I just wish that I could have gotten them."  Since then, she's been using the company's wireless headphones and listening to music on her cellphone.  "I've been wearing them for about 40-50 days," she said. "I hear a lot more music, I can hear better and I feel more secure, and I'm not the type to go out and drink and party."  She
 He started working out once again.  "I think I was going to make it to the NBA but the knee injury kept me out for a little while," Kaleb said. "I was going to try to get back in shape and I needed to get a new knee and I didn't have a lot of money.  "I finally got a new knee that day and I was able to train and play for a little bit. I was able to come back and help my team for a couple more years."  
 She worked out twice a week, but she was never really good at it, and she was terrified of the pain.  Her friend, Ashley, was helping her prepare for her first weight loss, and she began to feel better on her own. With her new diet, she was able to lose a few pounds and, with help, to regain the weight she'd lost.  "I'm not the kind of person who will eat a lot of carbohydrates," says Trina. "I don't want to eat anything that's not good
 It was a pretty sad story," said the boy whose mother has been in foster care in Ontario for 15 years. "She moved from place to place, and when she was 18, her dad found out about it and he was like, 'Oh my god, I'm not able to support my son. I'm going to have to find another guy.'"  The boy said his mother went to the police, but because of his age and lack of social skills, a judge sentenced him to an 18-month jail sentence.  The boy, now 22, has
 He knew he should have left it on the ground, but he had no idea where to put it!  He looked around the school, searching for a place to put the shirt. A girl who had just left was sitting in a chair in front of the window.  "What're you doing here?" he said.  "I'm taking a shower." she replied.  "I… I don't understand."  She seemed calm. Her face was expressionless.  "What's going on
 There was a time when he wanted to die. He was told he could die by suicide, so he did. He was able to leave that place, but was depressed. He knew he had to live. He wanted to leave. He was living in the same apartment of a woman he saw once before. They were going to have a baby, but he didn't want to have to leave the baby alone. He wanted to be able to call his wife so she could come over to his place to help. His wife was pregnant, and he wanted to
 They all spent an hour or so talking, and he eventually went his own way and picked up a few friends to try their hand at the hike. This is the hike I've taken many times. It's not easy, but I think it's worth it. Josh has been making it his life's work to try to complete this hike in under 2.5 hours, and I'm happy to say he's done it. I've been to plenty of hikes around here, but
  The restaurant was closed for lunch but the restaurant owner, who was also in the restaurant, asked Betty if they could get the burger back for lunch. Betty was hesitant but she agreed to try it. The burger came out hot!  Betty didn't want to leave the restaurant so she went out to the street and got a bag of onion chips. When she came back she found the bag was out of onion chips. Betty asked the man who had sold her the onion chips if she could get them back. He said yes
 He started working on the project last night, and here's what he came up with (I'm assuming, of course, that he didn't have a full day's worth of work to do):  There are a lot of things that you can do with this!

You can change things up to
 He'd also discovered that the instruments were not the best in the world for making chords, but he didn't care. He didn't want it to look like they were just some cheap toy. He wanted them to sound like instruments. He felt that the keys were a little too high, and couldn't hear the notes. He couldn't get them to play. There was one thing he could do. He could make them lower the pitch to make them sound more like notes: A

  "You know, it's an amazing juice. It's really good. It's a very different taste than what I normally get. It's great."  "Oh, I see. That's good. I'm very looking forward to our next session."

She was worried about her future. But the worst part was that her mom was so tired and she didn't have any time to think about it.

 It's actually a pretty long essay. I don't want to rehash it here, but you can read it in full here. It's a really good essay.  And I have to tell you, I was a little bit surprised by the way the American media treated me. If you look at the coverage, I think it's one of the most biased media that I've ever seen. There were several articles that were simply about me. For example, one article that I wrote in 2004 that was absolutely fantastic was about a man
 But the other day, I was at a restaurant with a bunch of other people and I saw that someone had sold out an entire restaurant. I had heard about that. So I was like, "Oh, that's amazing." And then all of a sudden when I got to my seat, I realized I had bought a ticket for that game, so I made sure I went. I was really excited about it. It was incredible.  I met so many people that I really care about. I met so many talented people in my world and

 I came in and put him back in and he was still awake and talking. He was still breathing. I don't think he realized that he had been out of surgery for almost one hour. He was probably unconscious for the whole time. We just kept him up in bed. It was just horrible. He really didn't want to talk. He couldn't move. He wasn't able to move his hands, he couldn't move his face. He was in pain. He was just in a bad way. It was really sad."
  She saw shoes online she wanted. She went to the local mall and bought them.  The two started to make eye contact.  "Well, that's interesting, huh?"

 I thought I could probably sneak it into my room, but it wasn't that easy.  "So, what's wrong with you?" She asked. It was a question I didn't expect her to ask.

 He went to the woods to avoid the dogs.  One day in June, a dog, named Lola, barked at the cabin.  "Oh, her," Johnson said. "Come, come. Come."  Lola ran towards the cabin.

 So I decided to make fish tacos. I used a combination of fish tacos made with fresh mushrooms, avocado, and cheese. I put a few of the mushrooms, avocado, and cheese on top of a fresh tortilla. I then fried the tortilla in a skillet. It was really good. I also mixed the fish with cilantro, lime juice, and a little bit of cumin. I fried the fish tacos and ate them. They were delicious! I can't wait to make these again.  I will definitely be making this again!

 There is a photo of her on the Internet showing her in her bathrobe, her legs spread and her butt in the water. I do not believe this photo exists, and I believe she is lying.

  It was fun. We talked about it for a while, and then we talked about it again. I think that's what was so surprising to me about the vote, the fact that I got it before it really started. I think it's just so exciting to be able to change the country. I think it's even more exciting to be able to change the environment. I think the environment is the most powerful force that we have.

She has chemotherapy for breast cancer, but she's not here. That's why I came back. So I had to leave, and I didn't get to see my niece again, because my sister was going out for the day. So I didn't get to see my daughter again.

 She would go home, eat, shower, and then come back to bed to finish work. Eventually, she started to see that she had a problem: she had to pay her bill as soon as the meal was ready. "I could never come up with the money."  Her boyfriend suggested she try a daycare. She was skeptical, so he suggested that she take a day off work for a few days.

 They thought the food was so awful that they thought they would never eat it again.  And then they discovered the new Asian fusion restaurant. It was called "Bangkok" and it was a place where they could eat good food and take it home to their families.  The staff was incredibly helpful and funny, and the food was awesome.  At least for now.  I am not complaining.  I am not angry.  I am not angry over the fact that I will never be able to eat
 The idea was for the two to go into the woods and pick up as much food as they could. The winner would be the person who could keep a record of the food they collected.

 She wanted me to talk about my new book on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  Her question was simple: What did you think of Jon Stewart's "Daily Show" segment?  I was skeptical.  I thought the show was a great idea that had potential, but I couldn't help but be surprised to see Jon Stewart on the show. I'm the first person to say he's fantastic and is a good guy. But he has never written a book, had no interest in writing one,

 His mother got him a burrito, he says he's eating it all the time.  "He was a little freaked out when we were getting him a burrito," said his grandmother, Kathy.

 This was my first experience of such a fun snack. It was so good that I had to stop by a couple of times!  My second trip to Mexico happened in 2013. I had heard so much good things about it, since I had already been visiting Mexico many times. It was my first experience of eating tamales and Cara was amazed. She told me that it was so good that she used to bring friends along, even when she was going out of town.  I wanted to try my hand at tortilla soup again
 The only other time she'd done that was when she was in the bathtub, and it was weird. She'd never done it before.  She looked back at him, eyes wide, mouth open, eyes wide and wide again.

 But his wife called and said, 'I can't do it because I got married.' And he said, 'Well, I didn't have to get married.' And she said, 'Well, then I got married, too.' It's just so ironic."

After the first day at school, the girls went and got ice cream, but as they were leaving, they heard that there was a fight going on at school.

 I sat there in silence for a few minutes. Finally, he said, "I guess you know what to do." So I went home.  I got home, went to sleep, and tried to concentrate on my work. I couldn't sleep because I felt sick. When I woke up, I just couldn't stop thinking about the man who said he didn't need me anymore. I went to the bathroom, washed my face and put on some makeup. But when I opened my eyes, my boss was gone

 She would sit there, she was usually the one who would have to sit there and watch TV, because her mom always wanted her to watch the TV and not worry about homework. She was always watching TV. She would never talk to her mom because she didn't like being asked questions. In fact, her mother would try to talk to her, like she was trying to talk to someone. But the thing is, there was no one left to talk to who was there to watch the TV. I said, "Mom, I want to talk to

 As she read she noticed that she could hear a noise in the background. She turned to see a black figure sitting at the edge of the room.  "What is that?" she asked.  "It's my dog!"

   We can't make a mistake, but we're not sure if that's right. It's not like she was going to be a maid of honor. She was the maid who worked in the house when we had to go to the airport. She was going to be the maid who cleaned up after us.   It's funny how she just keeps giving us these questions.   Sue: What's your favorite food?   Jenny: I guess I'd have to say the grilled pork chop.   Sue: There was

 But as soon as I saw the animals, I saw they were sick and tired of that. I took them to the vet and they were diagnosed with liver cancer."

"My friends and I decided to start a GoFundMe page, and here's the thing, we had to do it on Thursday because we were already at the petting zoo," said Bevilac
 The report was about the discovery of the new ship.   The reports were not published for over a month after Gina's report arrived at the university.

On the video, an officer can be heard telling him to sit down. Police can be heard telling him to leave.  "He's been crying for 15 minutes now," the officer can be heard saying.

  He says he was drawn to the idea of taking a guided tour of African ruins because it was the kind of thing he had always wanted to do. He wasn't sure he'd be able to do it on his own, but he knew he couldn't do it without help.  The first of three days of the tour was dedicated to taking in the sights.  For a while, I took a tour of the city of Lagos, which is about 500 kilometers away from downtown Lagos. The city is like a big

He then says that he will give the guest a free pizza.  Suddenly, Johnny is shocked when he sees the waiter has a huge order coming his way. He decides to give the
 And then his girlfriend got pregnant. And then there's that time when he was in a car accident.  So there's a certain amount of time where I had a lot of time to think about this for a lot of time. I think the thing I try to do is I try to have a point of view that doesn't necessarily make the story more interesting or more compelling. I try to have a point of view that I don't think I need to argue.  The thing is, sometimes I feel
 She wanted to feel like she was part of something great. She wanted to be able to show off her beautiful body to anyone who would listen. When she was 12 years old, she decided that she wanted to wear her first pair of pants in public. One day, she bought the jeans in an online store. She liked them so much that she decided to wear the pants to the store. After wearing the pants in public, the pants caught on fire in her hands and she burned her hands on it. All

  "I came up with the idea and I said 'Hey Joe, you're going to try and catch some fish. I think I can do it.' And he said 'I can't do it because I'm too old to fish.'"  "I don't think he was joking," says Joe.  "He was joking, yeah. He's a very tough man. He's been through a lot and he's still trying."

  It was all part of a plan.  "My dad was very strict about that," he said. "He told us not to eat bananas that weren't from his backyard."

 So, he decided to pay off $250 in rent for the month with the help of a friend.  "We decided to go to the bank and ask them for a loan," he said.

He and his friend took out a $1,000 loan at the bank, which turned into about $60,000 in interest a month.  "I

I've looked online for a cat rescue group but haven't found any that would take him in.  Is there anything you can think of to help someone else who has a stray cat?  I've heard of a group called the CatSafe for people with cats, but I haven't found one yet. I
 And, when she finally got a chance to take it, she did. She put the little tinsel in a bag, stuffed it in her purse, and mailed it out.

 It had to be a freak accident. The car was completely destroyed.  I have had a few minor accidents in my career, and I am only about to get my third. The last one happened about 10 years ago.

Even after I lost control, I still had a few inches of my bumper hanging off the bottom, and then my whole
 His son was the first rider of any age ever to ride a bike. The first bike that ever made it to the top of the mountain. The most powerful bike in the world.  He was the first man to ride a bicycle, and he was also the first person to ride it with a helmet.  But he never really thought much about the benefits of riding a bike. He didn't want to be the first to ride one.  He wasn't even sure if he could ride one.  The bike was a
 He had a wonderful sense of humour. He would write a story and then he would write the ending, usually with a twist.  He was a really funny chap. He was also very good with numbers.

 She was hungry. A girl in her family had been sick for a while, but she'd been getting better.
